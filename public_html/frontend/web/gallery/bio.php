Born in central Persia in 1974, Neda Badiei is blessed with a unique artistic talent that makes her paintings literally come alive. Many years of intense study across the world has enabled Ms Badiei to display a passion unseen by most other contemporary artists. The fascinating element for her was the interaction of many cultures and ethnicities, which Neda has incorporated into all of her oil paintings.  Subjects vary from incredibly detailed portraits, scenic landscapes, breath-taking wildlife and animals, and charming still life paintings.
Neda has a large portfolio of paintings for sale, or she is willing to paint most subjects on a special order basis.
