Teaching Art in Laguna Beach Studio
* Small group
* Individual 

classes at Laguna Beach Art Studio , offer the opportunity for intensive study, working from any subject appealing to student.

The process includes structure, proportion & how to correctly block in the outside graphic shape, drawing the contour, mixing colors and using mediums.
<br>
The techniques that Neda teaches will help students develop their artwork, conveying the natural organic forms and science of light on the form. Students will have the opportunity to work methodically through a process to compare what they see and draw from the subject. 

Nedaâ€™s teaching experience and artistry comes from years of study and practicing. 
During the classes students have the opportunity to further develop their artwork by working from still life or any photo they like. Students have the option to work independently to create their own paintings.
